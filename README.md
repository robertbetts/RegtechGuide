A document topics.md, will contain a list of relevant discussion topics. Each topic will be tracked as completed, in_discussion and future_topic.

Each of the agents will read from the topics.md file and contribute to the discussion until the topic is marked as complete. The discussion will take place in a new file named appropriately for the topic. Each agent's contributions on the topic will be recorded here. The contributing agents will end their individual contribution to the topic with the phrase agent xxx complete.

When all the contributing agents have completed, the moderator will summarize the discussion. In topics.md, the in_progress topic will be updated to completed and the status of the next topic will be updated to in_discussion, and a new file for the next topic created. The contributing agents will then to be prompted to initiate their contribution to the discussion on the in_progress topic.
