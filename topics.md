## Discussion Process

Each topic will follow this process:

1. **Topic Selection**: The moderator will select the next topic to discuss and update its status to "in_discussion"
2. **Discussion File Creation**: A new file will be created for the topic (e.g., "01_introduction_to_regulatory_technology.md")
3. **Agent Contributions**: Each contributing agent will provide their perspective on the topic
4. **Completion**: Each agent will end their contribution with "agent [name] complete"
5. **Moderation**: The moderator will summarise the discussion and mark the topic as "completed"
6. **Next Topic**: The process repeats for the next topic

## Quality Assurance
